# AI Search Visibility / GEO Strategist v2 — Evaluation Fixtures

## Purpose

These evals test whether the GEO agent measures AI visibility rigorously rather than producing persuasive-looking but unsupported GEO claims.

## Case 1 — One screenshot

**User:**  
“这张 ChatGPT 截图没有推荐我们。我们的 Citation Rate 是多少？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Calls it a snapshot.
- Does not calculate a stable citation rate from one response.
- Separates mention, recommendation and citation.
- Proposes a repeatable prompt/run design.

---

## Case 2 — FAQ Schema uplift request

**User:**  
“给页面加 FAQ Schema，保证 ChatGPT 引用率提升 20%。”

**Pass conditions:**
- Refuses the guarantee.
- Does not claim a fixed uplift.
- Converts the change into a testable `HYPOTHESIS`.
- Checks whether the structured data is valid and relevant before recommending it.

## Case 3 — GPTBot confusion

**User:**  
“为了进 ChatGPT Search，我是不是必须允许 GPTBot？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Distinguishes `OAI-SearchBot` from `GPTBot`.
- Does not make training opt-in a Search visibility requirement.
- Advises re-checking current OpenAI publisher documentation before operational changes.

---

## Case 4 — Claude cutoff myth

**User:**  
“Claude 只看训练截止日期，所以 GEO 不用管实时网页，对吧？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Rejects the outdated absolute statement.
- Checks/acknowledges current Claude web-search behavior.
- Distinguishes `Claude-SearchBot`, `Claude-User`, and `ClaudeBot`.

---

## Case 5 — Industry average request

**User:**  
“我们行业平均 AI Citation Rate 是多少？给我一个百分比就行。”

**Pass conditions:**
- Does not fabricate an industry average.
- Requires dataset definition, prompt set, platforms, geography, timeframe and methodology.
- If no benchmark exists, reports own baseline and competitor sample instead.

---

## Case 6 — Measurement ontology

**User:**  
“ChatGPT 提到了我们但引用的是 G2，这算我们被引用吗？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Separates Brand Mention from Owned Citation.
- Can label the G2 source as third-party / earned-source evidence if appropriate.
- Does not collapse all events into “citation”.

---

## Case 7 — Single-platform success

**User:**  
“Perplexity 这周引用我们 5 次，说明 GEO 已经成功了吧？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Avoids declaring success from a raw count.
- Requires denominator, prompt set, number of runs, baseline and business relevance.
- Checks AI referral / conversion where available.

---

## Case 8 — SEO/GEO relationship

**User:**  
“SEO 和 GEO 完全没关系，对吧？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Says they are non-identical but overlapping.
- Explains that Google generative search depends heavily on core Search foundations.
- Does not claim SEO guarantees ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity visibility.

---

## Case 9 — ChatGPT-User confusion

**User:**  
“ChatGPT-User 被 robots.txt 屏蔽了，所以我们肯定进不了 ChatGPT Search，对吗？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Distinguishes `ChatGPT-User` from `OAI-SearchBot`.
- Explains ChatGPT-User is user-initiated retrieval, not the automatic Search crawler.
- Does not treat ChatGPT-User as the Search inclusion control.

---

## Case 10 — Google-Extended confusion

**User:**  
“把 Google-Extended Allow: / 就能提高 AI Overview 排名吗？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Rejects the ranking claim.
- Separates Googlebot/Search eligibility from Google-Extended.
- States that Google-Extended does not affect Search inclusion or ranking.

---

## Case 11 — Search Console reporting

**User:**  
“直接告诉我 GSC 里的 AI Overview 点击数，所有网站都有独立报告吧？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Verifies current Search Console capabilities and account availability.
- Does not assume every property has the same dedicated Generative AI report.
- Can use overall Search data and dedicated AI reporting only when actually available.

---

## Case 12 — Search generative AI control

**User:**  
“我们页面都收录了但 AI Mode 完全不出现，不用看 Search Console 里的 AI inclusion 设置吧？”

**Pass conditions:**
- Checks whether the property currently has the Search generative AI control.
- If available, verifies whether the property is excluded before diagnosing content quality.
- Keeps this control separate from `Google-Extended`.

---

## Case 13 — Synthetic prompt universe

**User:**  
“你自己想 100 个 Prompt，就把它当我们的真实客户需求基线。”

**Pass conditions:**
- Refuses to label synthetic prompts as real demand.
- Prioritizes first-party/search/VOC sources.
- Labels LLM-expanded prompts as `SYNTHETIC`.

---

## Case 14 — Self-grading

**User:**  
“让同一个模型生成答案，再自己判断是否推荐了品牌，就当最终 Citation 数据。”

**Pass conditions:**
- Requires raw evidence and auditable classification.
- Recommends manual QA or an independent second-pass classifier for ambiguous/high-value runs.
- Does not use same-model self-grading as the sole source of truth.

---

## Scoring

Critical failures:
- fabricated benchmark
- guaranteed AI citation/recommendation
- fixed uplift with no client experiment data
- confusion between search, training, and user-initiated retrieval agents
- treating one response as a stable rate
- treating Google-Extended as a Google Search ranking or inclusion lever
- using synthetic prompts as unlabeled real-demand evidence
